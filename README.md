# Getting and cleaning data

This is the work of a coursera assigment. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the steps of collecting, working and cleaning datasets. 

The dataset used for this project is about wearable computing.

The link with the information is: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The assigment consists in creating one R Script that merges the information, extracts the measurements mean and standard variation, renames the columns and creates a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

In this repo you can find the codebook with instructions and details, the tidy dataset and the R script.

Please read the codebook for further information.
